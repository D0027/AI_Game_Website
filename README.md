## 🖥️ Mission Brief
**Neural Arena** is a comprehensive **AI Simulation Hub**. It demonstrates the practical application of complex algorithms through interactive gameplay. Unlike standard web games, every opponent here is driven by a specific Python-based AI agent running on the backend.

Built with a **Python Flask** backend and a reactive **Glassmorphism** frontend, the system simulates a high-tech command deck complete with terminal logs, ambient audio, and a responsive neon grid.

## 🌟 Core Modules

### 🎮 The Game Grid (35+ Simulations)
A visually stunning grid of AI-powered games. Each card features 3D Tilt effects and neon glow.

* **Classic AI:**
    * **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Powered by the **Minimax Algorithm** (Unbeatable).
    * **Connect 4:** Uses **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to look 5 moves ahead.
* **Pathfinding:**
    * **Neon Serpent (Snake):** Uses **BFS/DFS** to autopilot towards food.
    * **Neon Pac-Man:** Ghosts use **A* Search** to hunt the player.
* **Evolutionary:**
    * **Flappy Bird:** Demonstrates **Neuroevolution** (AI learns to fly).
    * **Chrome Runner:** Uses **Genetic Algorithms** to adapt to speed.
* **Logic & CSP:**
    * **Sudoku Solver:** Visualizes **Backtracking** logic.
    * **N-Queens:** Solves constraint satisfaction problems in real-time.

## 🧠 Algorithmic Engine

This project visualizes complex theoretical concepts through gameplay:

| Algorithm | Used In | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minimax** | Tic-Tac-Toe | Calculates all possible future moves to ensure a draw or win. |
| **A* (A-Star)** | Pac-Man / Slide Puzzle | Finds the absolute shortest path between two points. |
| **Backtracking** | Sudoku / N-Queens | Recursively solves constraint satisfaction problems. |
| **Genetic Algo** | Neon Runner | Evolves better agents over generations (survival of the fittest). |
| **BFS / DFS** | Snake / Maze | Breadth-First and Depth-First Search for graph traversal. |
| **Simulated Annealing** | Network (TSP) | Solves optimization problems by mimicking metallurgy. |
